libusb-1.0 bindings for Node.js
==============================
node-usb is just a sample of how to interact between node.js ->  Google V8 -> external libraries (in this case libusb-1.0).
At the moment only discovering of availble devices is possible and no asynchronous support is integrated.

Tested with Node version 0.2.4

Installation
==============================
Make sure you have installed libusb-1.0-0-dev (Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev).
Just run
	make setup
in current directory and wait. "Unit tests" can be executed with
	node tests/node-usb-test.js

If you want to use the USB vendor ids, execute
	make create-usb-ids

Examples
=============================
A simple version of lsusb can be executed by typing
	node examples/lsusb.js


TODO
=============================
* Move to asynchronous calls
* read/write streams
* ...
